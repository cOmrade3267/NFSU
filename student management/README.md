Student Management System
A console-based C++ application for managing student records in an educational institution. This system provides basic CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for student data management with an easy-to-use command-line interface.
Features

Add new student records with enrollment number, name, and semester information
Display all stored student records in a formatted layout
Search for specific students using enrollment numbers
Delete student records by enrollment number
Modify existing student records using index-based selection
Support for up to 20 student records
Input validation and error handling
Clean and organized object-oriented design

Technical Details
The project is structured around two main classes:

Student: Manages individual student data and operations
StudentManager: Handles the collection of student records and provides interface methods

Implementation Highlights

Uses C++ standard libraries
Implements encapsulation through private data members and public interfaces
Memory-efficient fixed-size array implementation
Proper input handling including support for names with spaces
Clean console-based user interface

Exit program

Building and Running
Compile using any C++ compiler that supports C++11 or later. For example:
bashCopyg++ student_management.cpp -o student_management
./student_management
